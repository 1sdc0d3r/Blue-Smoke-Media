          Social Media: Why It Is 100% Essential (and How to Use It Well).
        </h1>
        <p>
          Social media is a form of electronic communication designed to let
          people share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. While
          many people access social media through smartphone apps, this
          communication tool started with computers, and social media can refer
          to any internet communication tool that allows users to broadly share
          content and engage with the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Wikipedia, “Social media are interactive
          computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing
          of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression
          via virtual communities and networks.” They go on further to
          say,”Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of
          connectedness with real or online communities and can be an effective
          communication (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs,
          non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and
          governments.”

          In today’s society, word of mouth IS digital. Think about the
          questions you constantly ask about products, services or businesses;
          your customers are asking the SAME questions. Addressing these common
          points of confusion could be your key to converting casual website
          visitors into new clients. The biggest question of all though, is
          whether potential customers will WANT to visit your website based on
          your social media presence. So, start or join a conversation, and
          participate with the idea in mind that you can achieve a significant
          influence. Take a hold and grow your brand by taking hold of your
          social media presence!
        </p>
        <p>
          “How can a social media presence help my business?” Social media is
          used to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current
          and possible new clients, and help foster new business. Again, you ask
          “How?” Let’s start with some statistics that will help you to
          understand the importance of social media marketing. In fact, it is so
          important that 97% of marketers are using social media and 78% of
          salespeople outsell their peers simply by using social media for their
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, not all businesses are aware of the benefits of social media
          marketing. In fact, 50% of small businesses aren’t using social
          media to promote their business and an additional 25% don’t plan to
          use social media in the future. There is clearly a large disconnect
          between those who are seeing the benefits of social media and those
          struggling to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may ask, “How will my business benefit from and active social
          media presence?” Here are just three of the ways your business could
          benefit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ◆ Social Media can be a valuable tool as profiles can provide
            general information and updates about your business.
          </li>

          <li>
            ◆ Business can interact and engage with current and future clients
            in a community like setting.
          </li>

          <li>
            ◆ Your business’ social profiles can also help improve your organic
            SEO for your website.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Mike Rosa of 180Fusion, stated that “If small businesses want to
          compete, if they want to level the playing field with their
          competitors, if they don’t want to lose ground, they have to be
          participating in social media.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The world of digital tech is a constantly moving landscape with social
          media marketing seeming to move even faster. And because it’s so fast
          moving it can be tough to figure out how each piece of the puzzle fits
          with your small business. Social Media Engagement remains an essential
          ingredient of business and marketing success. To win over audiences in
          a world increasingly dominated by instantaneous social media and the
          24-hour news cycle, the power of connecting with people can be the
          difference between success and failure.
