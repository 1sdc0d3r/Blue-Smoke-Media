      <h1> Social Media: What is and why you should use it!</h1>
      <p>
        Social media is a form of electronic communication designed to let
        people share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. While many
        people access social media through smartphone apps, this communication
        tool started with computers, and social media can refer to any internet
        communication tool that allows users to broadly share content and engage
        with the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Wikipedia, “Social media are interactive computer-mediated
        technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information,
        ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual
        communities and networks.” They go on further to say,”Social media can
        help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real
        or online communities and can be an effective communication
        (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit
        organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments.”

        In today’s society, word of mouth IS digital. Think about the questions
        you constantly ask about products, services or businesses; your
        customers are asking the SAME questions. Addressing these common points
        of confusion could be your key to converting casual website visitors
        into new clients. The biggest question of all though, is whether
        potential customers will WANT to visit your website based on your social
        media presence. So, start or join a conversation, and participate with
        the idea in mind that you can achieve a significant influence. Take a
        hold and grow your brand by taking hold of your social media presence!
      </p>
      <p>
        “How can a social media presence help my business?” Social media is used
        to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current and
        possible new clients, and help foster new business. Again, you ask
        “How?” Let’s start with some statistics that will help you to understand
        the importance of social media marketing. In fact, it is so important
        that 97% of marketers are using social media and 78% of salespeople
        outsell their peers simply by using social media for their business.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not all businesses are aware of the benefits of social media
        marketing. In fact, 50% of small businesses aren’t using social media to
        promote their business and an additional 25% don’t plan to use social
        media in the future. There is clearly a large disconnect between those
        who are seeing the benefits of social media and those struggling to get
        started.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may ask, “How will my business benefit from and active social media
        presence?” Here are just three of the ways your business could benefit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ◆ Social Media can be a valuable tool as profiles can provide general
          information and updates about your business.
        </li>

        <li>
          ◆ Business can interact and engage with current and future clients in
          a community like setting.
        </li>

        <li>
          ◆ Your business’ social profiles can also help improve your organic
          SEO for your website.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Mike Rosa of 180Fusion, stated that “If small businesses want to
        compete, if they want to level the playing field with their competitors,
        if they don’t want to lose ground, they have to be participating in
        social media.”
      </p>

        The world of digital tech is a constantly moving landscape with social
        media marketing seeming to move even faster. And because it’s so fast
        moving it can be tough to figure out how each piece of the puzzle fits
        with your small business. Social Media Engagement remains an essential
        ingredient of business and marketing success. To win over audiences in a
        world increasingly dominated by instantaneous social media and the
        24-hour news cycle, the power of connecting with people can be the
        difference between success and failure.
