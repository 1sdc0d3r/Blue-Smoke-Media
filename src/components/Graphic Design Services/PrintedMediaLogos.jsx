            One of the toughest design projects is reducing the identity of an
            organization to a single symbol. Many companies are complex systems
            of individuals and entities working toward a variety of goals. Our
            identities are the result of a process that remains flexible while
            at the same time building a brand. Looking for a unique image to
            represent your corporate identity? Or do you just need to modify
            your current logo for your web site? At
