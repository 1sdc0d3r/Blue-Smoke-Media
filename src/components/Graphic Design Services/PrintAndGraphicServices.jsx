            Design will take an ordinary experience and turn it into a powerful
            experience, one that is not quickly forgotten. Leaving this kind of
            impression on your customer, is an integral key to success. Good
            design has power; it may be hard to measure, but there are ways to
            see the value inherent in purposeful, targeted and personal design.

                    <span>Recognition - </span>Who are you? What do you do? It’s
                    got to show, and it’s got to be clear. If people can
                    recognize and differentiate you from the crowd, you’re going
                    to do better than the crowd.

                    <span>Remembrance - </span>If they can’t remember who you
                    were or what you were about, your chances of doing business
                    with them again are probably slim. Good design will make an
                    impression on your customers or clients. They won’t forget
                    about you.

                  <span>Respect - </span>Believe it or not, good design is
                  apparent to almost everyone. They might not know exactly why,
                  but they know when something looks good. People respect design
                  because it shows that you care about how you look. It’s an
                  easy connection to make that if you care about how you look,
                  you care just as much about your products, services and ideas.
                  People will see that and respect you.

                  <span>Trust - </span>Respect leads to Trust and Trust is
                  priceless. Design plays a very important part in establishing
                  Trust with the people you work with. It’s not the only part,
                  but it’s something that is often overlooked as unnecessary, or
                  not worth the expense. It is worth it; you want to give your
                  client the right impression.

                  An appropriate brochure, business card, logo or any printed
                  media is a necessity when it comes to spreading the word about
                  your company. And “appropriate” might mean the use of a burlap
                  envelope, a tipped-on photo, or a cinnamon-stick binding — it
                  all depends on your industry and your objectives. We get to
                  know you and what you do to be sure that your literature
                  conveys an accurate image. Every project at{" "}
                  <span>Blue Smoke Digital and Printed Media,</span> is custom
                  designed to your digital or graphic media needs, specifically
                  to address the individual challenges of each project we work

                  new corporate identity, or a one-of-a-kind promotion you have
                  our guarantee that it will be unique.
