          <h1>Creating Your Website</h1>
          <p>
            At <span>Blue Smoke Digital Media,</span> we take website usability
            seriously. Your website is an investment that should benefit you and
            your company by helping your visitors find what they’re looking for.
            In addition to ensuring that your website is clear and easy to use,
            we’ll address issues of necessary information, speed of download,
            how information “flows” through your site, and more . Our website
            design includes solid graphic design skills, high-end programming
            website application, and cutting edge website optimization
            techniques. We will do everything you need to greatly improve your
            business Web presence. We’ll explain exactly what you do or do not
            need and why, and then we’ll do everything for you. Here are the
            steps we take:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Meet with you, in person or on the phone, to learn exactly what
              you want and expect. Here we help you come up with concrete goals
              you want to achieve with the new website. We’ll discuss with you
              possible new Web services and lead generation features you can
              include and what ones you want to include from your old site.
            </li>
            <li>
              We’ll review your old website with you and determine along with
              you what features should be included or left out of the new site
              (read 10 Prominent Websites Design Mistakes, article).
            </li>
            <li>
              We’ll investigate what worked and didn’t work with your old site
              and plan your new site accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assess how your current server platform is working for you. We’ll
              also assess how your site’s Web programming is performing. We’ll
              explain the different computer server platforms and languages you
              can choose from and the pros and cons of each. If you decide you
              want a new platform or technology, we’ll help you determine which
              to choose for your new site and what Web programming will be
              needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will guide you through the development of your new look & feel
              Web design (if you decide you want a new look & feel), helping you
              decide what will best communicate your business message.
