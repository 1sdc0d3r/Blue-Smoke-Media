            into compelling copy. The overall aim is to give your customers

            <span className="orange">1. Step back from your site.</span> Many
            site owners are too close to their products to describe them
            effectively. You can begin to lose sight of what makes your product
            different, and how you can describe how they will benefit someone.
            While you may think that a certain feature is extremely obvious and
            needs no description, someone who has never seen the same product
            may not understand this. <span>Blue Smoke Media</span> will help you
            take that “step back” and analyze your site making recommendations
            about any potential need for change.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="orange"> 2. Use psychology.</span> People often
            make purchases because they believe the item will make them feel
            better or make their lives easier. How can your product or service
            benefit someone? Make a list of the different benefits that your
            product can offer and then use these points in your copy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="orange">3. Keep it brief.</span>{" "}
            <span>Blue Smoke Media</span> will help you decide what the critical
            points are, present the information is an accessible manner. Short
            sentences, bulleted lists, and other ways that don’t overwhelm your
            visitors are just a few of the suggestions we might purpose.
