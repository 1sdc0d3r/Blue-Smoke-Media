 {\" \"}\n          Social Media: Why It Is 100% Essential (and How to Use It Well)\n        </h1>\n        <p>\n          Social media is a form of electronic communication designed to let\n          people share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. While\n          many people access social media through smartphone apps, this\n          communication tool started with computers, and social media can refer\n          to any internet communication tool that allows users to broadly share\n          content and engage with the public.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          According to{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\">Wikipedia</a>,\n          “Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that\n          facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas, career\n          interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and\n          networks.” They go on further to say, ”Social media can help to\n          improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or \n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online\">online</a>\n           communities and can be an effective communication (or \n          <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing\">marketing</a>) tool\n          for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy\n          groups, political parties, and governments.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In today’s society, word of mouth IS digital. Think about the\n          questions you constantly ask about products, services or businesses;\n          your customers are asking the SAME questions. Addressing these common\n          points of confusion could be your key to converting casual website\n          visitors into new clients. The biggest question of all though, is\n          whether potential customers will WANT to visit your website based on\n          your social media presence. So, start or join a conversation, and\n          participate with the idea in mind that you can achieve a significant\n          influence. Take a hold and grow your brand by taking hold of your\n          social media presence!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          “How can a social media presence help my business?” Social media is\n          used to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current\n          and possible new clients, and help foster new business. Again, you ask\n          “How?” Let’s start with some statistics that will help you to\n          understand the importance of social media marketing. In fact, it is so\n          important that 97% of marketers are using social media and \n          <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2013/05/19/study-78-of-salespeople-using-social-media-outsell-their-peers/#715beee67c32\">\n            78% of salespeople outsell their peers\n          </a>\n           simply by using social media for their business.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          However, not all businesses are aware of the benefits of social media\n          marketing. In fact, \n          <a href=\"http://stlblackbiz.com/small-businesses-arent-readily-using-social-media/\">\n            50% of small businesses aren’t using social media\n          </a>\n           to promote their business and an additional 25% don’t plan to use\n          social media in the future. There is clearly a large disconnect\n          between those who are seeing the benefits of social media and those\n          struggling to get started.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You might ask, “How will my business benefit from an active social\n          media presence?” Here are just three of the ways your business could\n          benefit:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            ◆ Social Media can be a valuable tool as profiles can provide\n            general information and updates about your business.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            ◆ Businesses can interact and engage with current and future clients\n            in a community like setting.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            ◆ Your businesses social profiles can also help improve your organic\n            SEO for your website.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          <a href=\"https://clutch.co/agencies/resources/social-media-2015-small-business-survey\">\n            Mike Rosa\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          of 180Fusion, stated that “If small businesses want to compete, if\n          they want to level the playing field with their competitors, if they\n          don’t want to lose ground, they have to be participating in social\n          media.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The world of digital tech is a constantly moving landscape with social\n          media marketing seeming to move even faster. And because it’s so fast\n          moving it can be tough to figure out how each piece of the puzzle fits\n          with your small or corporate business. Social Media Engagement remains\n          an essential ingredient of business and marketing success. To win over\n          audiences in a world increasingly dominated by instantaneous social\n          media and the 24-hour news cycle, the power of connecting with people\n          can be the difference between success and failure.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you would like to increase your Social Media Presence or create it,\n          I invite you to give us a <a href=\"tel:8652741371\">call</a>,{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"mailto:services@bluesmokemedia.net\">email</a>, or{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            zoom\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          us at Blue Smoke Digital and Printed Media.

find plenty of\n          bad copy Here are some useful tips that will help you turn your\n          existing Website content into compelling copy. The overall aim is to\n          give your customers enough information, properly presented and\n          illustrated, to enable them to choose your company, your product or\n          service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <span className=\"orange\">1.

While you may\n          think that a certain feature is extremely obvious and needs no\n          description, someone who has never seen the same product may not\n          understand this. <span>Blue Smoke Digital Media</span> will help you\n          take that “step back” and analyze your site making recommendations\n          about any potential need for change.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <span className=\"orange\"> 2.

With minimal design and highly maintained archives, they continue to offer comprehensive services. However, prominent mistakes on several websites are still apparent. Here is a list of the website mistakes that scares visitors away and ruins the business's reputation.\n\n<span>1. The under-construction sign.</span> Putting an 'under construction' sign on your website marks you as a struggling beginner. Websites are supposed to grow in time. If your site is not yet ready to be shown in public, then don’t publish it.\n\n<span>2. Visitor counters.</span> Visitors generally are not bothered by the fact that many other people have visited your site. However, if the visitor counter shows a low number, that can be a psychological turn-off to people, if it's too high, people might think that it’s fictitious. The best way to do this is not to include it on your website. If you really want to know how many visitors you have had, check your analytics.\n\n<span>3. Lack of copyright statements.</span> Everything you write and create on the including your website is copyright-able. Make certain that you include copyright statements on every page, and appropriately update the copyright year.\n\n<span>4. Overuse of technology.</span> There are some really great and cool new technologies available today but they can tend to distract the visitors. In times that you have to choose between new technology and simplicity. Choose the latter for it is anchored on the website’s functionality.\n\n<span>5. Passive verbs.</span> Use active verbs and active sentences when writing your site's copy. Active verbs are powerful and lend energy to your site. The more conversational the website is the better.\n\n<span>6. Long sentences.</span> Long sentences are tedious to read. Better keep it short and simple so that it can easily be retained.\n\n<span>7. Lengthy pages.</span> Keep your pages brief and concise. People are easily bored with reading, so you have to adjust to their attention span. If you have a lot to say, you can create a series of pages with good navigation to explain your topics.\n\n<span>8. Not identifying the benefits of your products or services.</span> There are two reasons why people make purchases. The first is to get rid of pain and the second is to get pleasure. They want to discern how your products and services will help them with their definite pain/pleasure situation.\n\n<span>9. Neglecting to ask the visitor to do something.</span> In marketing, this is known as a Call To Action (CTA). There should be a space designated to tell your visitors what you want them to do next. \"Sign up for my newsletter.\" \"Order now!\"\n\n<span>10. Accepting as true the maxim build it and they will come.</span> Once you've built your website you have to let people know about it. If you don't deliver them to people, then your website is not worth the money you spent to create them!`\n    },\n    {\n        id: 2,\n        title: \"How Website Design Can Affect Search Engine Rankings\",\n        author: \"John Metzler\",\n        date: \"\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_2_how-website-design-can-affect-search-engine-rankings.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"How Website Design Can Affect Search Engine Rankings\",\n        category: \"Search Engine Optimization\",\n        tags: \"Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Organic SEO, Website Content Writing\",\n        snippet: \"Uniquely built websites can create unique issues when being promoted on the search engines.

From a basic 3 page brochure website to a corporate branding website with hundreds of dynamically generated pages, every website needs to have certain digital graphic design aspects in order to achieve the full effects of an SEO campaign. Below are a few points to take into consideration when building or updating your website.\n\n<span>1. Size Matters.</span>\nThe size of a website can have a huge impact on search engine rankings. Search engines love content, so if you have only a few pages to your site and your competitors have dozens, it's difficult to see a top page ranking for your site. In some cases it may be difficult to present several pages of information about your business or products, so you may need to think about adding free resources for visitors. It will help in broadening the scope of your website (which search engines like), as well as keep visitors on your site longer, possibly resulting in more sales.\n\n<span>2. Graphics-Based Websites.</span>\nWhile websites that offer the visitor a more aesthetically-pleasing experience may seem like the best choice for someone searching for your product, they are the most difficult to optimize. Since search engine robots cannot read text within graphics or animation, what they see may be just a small amount of text. And if we learned anything from point #-1, small amounts of content will not result in top rankings. If you really must offer the visitor a graphics-heavy website, consider creating an html-based side of your website that is also available to visitors. This site will be much easier to promote on the search engines and your new found visitors will also have the option to jump over to the nicer looking part of your website.\n\n<span>3. Dynamic Web Pages.</span>\nIf most of your website is generated by a large database (such as a large book dealer with inventory that is changing by the minute), you may find that some of your pages do not get indexed by major search engines. If you look at the URL of these pages they can be extremely long and have characters such as ?, #, &, %, or = along with huge amounts of seemingly random numbers or letters. Since these pages are automatically generated by the database as needed, the search engines have a tough time keeping them up to date and relevant for search engine users.\n\nOne way to combat this problem is to offer a search engine friendly site map listing all your static pages just to let them know that you do have permanent content on your site. If search engines see links going to and from these dynamic pages within a good internal linking system, this may also lead to the pages getting indexed. The link popularity of your site may carry more weight in this case as well, so if you can't offer as much static content as your competition, make sure you have an aggressive link campaign on the go.\n\n<span>4. Proper Use of Html5.</span>\nThere is quite a bit of sub-par web design software out there. Text editors usually have a way to create html documents which can be easily uploaded to a site via ftp. However, in many cases the code that the search engine robots see is mostly lines and lines of font and position formatting, not relevant content. The more efficiently written websites usually achieve higher rankings. Our choice for web design, video creation, and graphic design software is the Adobe Creative Suite, as it is an industry standard. We write our own code using HTML5, JavaScript, React.js and Python. Writing our own code makes using CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets) a breeze, which can drastically reduce the amount of text formatting in HTML and JavaScript. Hand-coding HTML and JavaScript to design sites is a great method if you are proficient enough.\n\nThere are some no brainers too: websites with abnormal amounts of hyperlinks, bold or italicized text, improper use of heading, alt, or comment tags can also expect to see low rankings.\n\n<span>5. Choosing a Domain Name.</span>\nThe golden rule to web development of any kind is to keep your visitors in mind above all else - even search engine optimization. When choosing a domain name, one should pick either your business name (if you have a high-profile business name such as Olive Garden or Coca-Cola) or a brief description of your products. Domain names can always help with search engine optimization, since it is another area of your website in which important keywords can appear. Forget about long-winded domains such as www.number-one-best-books-on-earth.com. No one will ever remember it and it will be hard to print on business cards or in ads.\n\nIf you need to change your domain name for any reason you obviously don't want to lose existing rankings. An easy way to do this, and one that is currently supported by most search engines, is the 301 redirect. It allows you to keep your existing rankings for your old domain name, while forwarding visitors to your new website instantly.\n\n<span>6. Update Your Information.</span>\nNot only does information printed two or three years ago reflect badly on your organization when it is read by a visitor, it is also looked down upon by search engines. Businesses that continuously update and grow their websites usually experience higher rankings than stagnant sites. When the trick to SEO is offering visitors the most relevant information, you can bet that the age of web pages is taken into consideration by search engines. Consider creating a section of your site devoted to news within your organization, or have a constantly updated resources area.\n\nMany shortfalls of websites can easily be attributed to designers who just do not keep the user or search engines in mind. Search engine algorithms are constantly improving to try and list the most user-friendly sites higher, given that the content and link popularity are there to back it up. So first and foremost, know your target market and make your website work for them before focusing on search engine optimization. If you build it (properly), they will come.`\n    },\n    {\n        id: 3,\n        title: \"Ad Copy Inspection - Cover These 12 Points!\",\n        author: \"Daniel Levis\",\n        date: \"\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_3_ad-copy-writing-image.png\",\n        imageAlt: \"Getting a piece of 'Advertising Copy'to come through for you and getting stellar results by following these 12 points!\",\n        category: \"Ad-Copywriting\",\n        tags: \"Ad-copywriting, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Organic SEO, Strategic Social Media Marketing, Website Content Writing, Reputation Management\",\n        snippet: \"You are ready to launch that new product or promotion, & you are really counting on a piece of advertising copy to come through for you.

Are Your Headlines Pleasing to the Eye?</span>\nI most often find that headlines work best when they are centered on the page, & present a balanced appearance in terms of the shape they create. Encasing them in quotation marks also serves to grab more attention. Long top headlines tend to reduce readership, but if they help qualify more effectively they can improve sales! Try them, but look for ways to modularize the text using punctuation & spacing so your readers do not suffocate trying to read them. Sometimes a long top headline is better presented as two or even three separate headlines.\n\n<span>3. Is Your Opening Provocative and Arresting?</span>\nDoes it trip the reader, interrupting the internal turbulence of the day? Each line of your ad copy must serve to 'sell' the reader on continued reading, especially at the beginning. You are looking to build enough momentum and interest to convey the points necessary to generate a greater desire for the product than its price. Generally speaking, the higher the cost of the product, the more words required.\n\n<span>4. Are You FAB Balanced?</span>\nYou must focus on painting a picture of your prospects future life, as a result of their purchase. Does your copy promise emotional benefits? Does it pledge the realization of positive feelings or the relief of negative ones? Does it show how these outcomes are achieved with concise descriptions of the features & advantages that will deliver them? Your ad copy must strike a balance between emotion and logic if it is to be effective.\n\n<span>5. Are You Creating Excitement and Enthusiasm?</span>\nDemonstrate your personal belief in what you are selling. Will your message quicken the readers pulse? Is it upbeat, positive, & full of inspired energy? Is there a sense of WOW?\n\n<span>6. Is Your Body Copy Highly Readable?</span>\nBare in mind that simple is best. Keep sentences short. Use a plain 0-point to 12-point font. Paragraphs no more than a few lines. Words that are comfortable and specific to the audience you are targeting. Inject subheads to break up text. Highlight important points.\n\n<span>7. Do You Have High YOU density?</span>\nRemember to you use the words YOU and YOUR to the hilt. Your reader is auto translating to ME & MINE.\n\n<span>8. Are You Speaking Intimately?</span>\nCan you get a strong sense of personality when you review your letter after being away from it for a while? Visualize yourself or the character you are personifying, writing a personal letter to your perfect prospect. Never write to a crowd.\n\n<span>9. Are You Inspiring the Readers Imagination?</span>\nYou must trigger mental images with your writing. The mind has difficulty distinguishing between vividly painted word pictures and reality. Daydreams enchant and emotions flow in their wake. When you have emotion, you have desire. When you have desire, you have suggestibility. When you have suggestibility, you can direct action. Your levers are allegory (storytelling), metaphor, similes, verbs, adjectives, & specificity.\n\n<span>10. Do You Offer Proof?</span>\nSpecific testimonials and convincing guarantees worked into your ad copy are essential.\n\n<span>11. Is Your Offer Irresistible?</span>\nPeople are greedy and they don’t part with their money easily. Are you piling bonuses on top of your reasons why they should part with their hard earned money, in exchange for immediate action?\n\n<span>12. And finally, Do You Have a Killer P.S.?</span>\nFor some reason, the P.S. at the bottom of a sales letter gets read a lot. Make it stop your reader in their tracks, like a deer in the headlights! Associate a positive outcome with taking the desired action or a negative one with delay or inaction. So there you have it. Exercise this 12-step ad copy checklist before your sales rubber hits the road.`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-4 --->  \"image-file-types.jpg\"    */\n\n    {\n        id: 4,\n        title: \"The Difference Between a Print Logo and a Web Logo\",\n        author: \"Constance Beebe\",\n        date: \"06/2020\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_4_image-file-types.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"The Difference Between a Print Logo and a Web Logo\",\n        category: \"Logos\",\n        tags: \"Digital and Print Logo Design, Digital Media Logos, Graphic Design, Printed Media Graphic Design, Corporate Branding\",\n        snippet: \"The difference between Print Logos and Digital Logos\",\n        content: `\nPrint logos require a much higher resolution (i.e., pixels per inch - begins at 300px), to create your project.

More and more, the major search engines are continuing to master the ability to identify natural human language and evaluate a web page based on natural human language. Back in the late 90’s and early 2000’s, AskJeeves.com was the first search engine to attempt to move to a natural human language system, although they focused on the user input aspect of search rather than evaluating the natural language of a web page itself.\n\nBy learning to identify natural human language, search engines are able to greatly reduce the amount of search engine spam. The advances of search engines continue, especially on the heels of<a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history\"> Google's constant algorithm </a>changes which will enable Google to weigh the relevance of links against the content of their pages. Search engines will continue to look at the entire content of websites and continue to attempt to identify the real subjects and themes of any given site. However with Google, Mobile and Content have become their primary focus.\n\nAs the AI’s for the search engines learn to better identify the natural language structure of websites, sites that are well formed will have a natural advantage. Although good search engine rankings will always depend on more than just the structure and content of a website, the content of a website will always be the heart of a page's rankings.\n\n<span>Make a Search Engine's Job Easy.</span>\nSearch engine spiders have a lot of work to do. Not only do they spider billions of pages every month attempting to discover new web pages and update already discovered web pages, these spiders need to parse through hundreds or even thousands of lines of code trying to distinguish between titles, content, structural code, and even the occasional keyword stuffing by search engine spammers. By simplifying your website, you make the job easier for the spider and allow the spider to index more pages on your site in a shorter amount of time.\n\n<span class=\"italic\">Avoid Bloated Code (Keep it DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself!)</span>\n\nUnfortunately for the sake of design, many website owners have paid absolutely no attention to how efficient their code is. As a result, they may have a lot of extraneous, unnecessary code. The result of bloated code is a page that may be difficult and confusing for a search engine to decipher, or the spider may misinterpret the code. Fortunately, HTML and CSS has caught up to the design standards of website professionals. Using proper HTML and CSS, you can design extremely responsive appealing websites.\n\nIf you would like to see just how versatile and effective HTML and CSS is,look at the examples laid out at CSS Zen Garden. CSS Zen Garden is a website that displays the power of CSS and properly formed HTML. There are several different designs all using the exact same HTML, but through CSS they are able to build sites that looking completely different form each other. If you want to see something very amazing about what CSS Zen Garden is doing, follow these steps: View the HTML of their page. It does not matter what style you are viewing, the HTML is the same for every style. Now copy that code and paste it into your HTML editor and view the output. The page that you will see is an extremely basic looking page. More importantly, though, the page that you will see is a very well organized page which would be easy for any spider to understand.\n\nLearn More About HTML If you are like most website owners, you know very little about HTML. You may know a little bit of code here and there, but it really does not seem worth your time to learn the inner workings of HTML. If you feel this way, then you are really missing out on great SEO opportunities. There are plenty of FREE websites from which you can learn to code from. <a href='https://www.codecademy.com'>CodeAcademy</a> and <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org'>FreeCodeCamp</a> are two of my favorites.\n\nHTML is built to naturally identify parts of your web page that are more important than others. It was built to be extremely organized. Using the organization that HTML provides, you can help a search engine spider identify the parts of your website that are more important.\n\nBelow are some uncommon tags that HTML provides that you can use to help organize your content: the Alt Tag – Most website owners know about this, but including an Alt-Tag on your images is actually required if you want to have a properly formed website. The caption tag allows you to identify what a specific table is about. The element should be styled using the CSS properties caption-side and text-align.\n\nThe H Tags – H1 tags have become some of the most important tags in SEO circles, once website owners learned that Google DID pay attention to this tag. However, there are actually 6 different heading tags. The H1 tag is the most important while the H6 tag is the least important. If a search engine were to try to form a table of contents from a website, it should be able to do so from the H tags. These are just a few examples, but HTML provides several tags for your content to help you organize your material, and help search engines know what to emphasize in your content. Article Tip: We have started a thread of these HTML tags. If you would like to know more about HTML tags and CSS, check out <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>here</a>.\n\nThe lesson from this should be that learning HTML is not an endeavor that has few benefits. There is a lot of HTML that can help you both simplify your code and add more content to help your rankings. Fortunately, web technology is catching up. With the advent of HTML5 (and working on HTML6) and CSS3, it is easier now than ever to create beautiful sites. If you are not familiar with CSS, just read that previous sentence as being a very good thing. As was demonstrated by the example of CSSZenGarden.com, CSS can be used to create a page that is extremely appealing. Most website owners know CSS to be a tool that they can use to edit the appearance of text and the colors of their site, but CSS is also a tool that can be used for the layout of your site. As CSS comes out with newer versions, layout will become a more important development. If you plan to design your own website, I would like to suggest you learn HTML and CSS. A little Javascript wouldn’t hurt.\n\nThe Side Benefit: Accessibility! Did you know that blind people surf the Internet? That may not seem shocking initially, but consider that the Internet is a highly visual medium of transferring information. Blind people are able to use web readers and Braille machines that interpret HTML code.Unfortunately, the vast majority of websites are not accessible for blind people because they are not well formed sites. By moving to a well formed website, you will be adding access for an audience who marketers really do not focus on.  But they should!\n\nAccessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript), more accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nIt supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, WAI-ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML5, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more. \n\nGoogle has now begun to implement certain penalties for either Not using the Wai-Aria codes or using them incorrectly.  Here is a guide from the <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria>Google Developers</a> on how to properly use the Aria codes.\n\nArticle Tip: Search engines love websites that adhere to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.\n\nBringing it back to SEO, many website owners are reluctant to take the time, energy, and money to really learn HTML and CSS, or to learn how they can make their websites truly accessible. However, in the end, they could be hurting their search engine rankings once search engines move closer to identifying natural human language.\n\nThe creators of HTML have done a magnificent job in creating a structure that can be used to organize your content in ways that make search engine optimization extremely easy. As the owner of your website, you should take care to make sure that it is running the way it was intended to. You would never purchase a car that fails to meet basic standards of quality, so why would you trust your company's income to a website that is based on code that does not meet the quality standards of the Internet?\n\nDesigning your site properly does take time and effort, but the rewards are numerous. Not only will you have the satisfaction of having a website that is both light in its code and efficient, but search engines will be able to identify the key points of your content much easier, thus giving you more control of your rankings.`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-6   --->  \"Advantages_of_Social_Media.jpg\" <----    */\n\n    {\n        id: 6,\n        title: \"The Local Search Revolution has Arrived!...optimize your online LOCAL presence now - before the learning curve turns expensive.\",\n        author: \"Esoos Bobnar\",\n        date: \"\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_6_Advantages of Social Media.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"The Advantages of Local Search and how it can effect your business\",\n        category: \"Local Search\",\n        tags: \"Local Search, Consumer Loyalty, Organic SEO, Website Content Writing, Ad-Copywriting, Website Usability\",\n        snippet: \"While searching the web these days, it's hard not to notice all those little Local tabs sprouting up in the vicinity of the search field on virtually every major search engine.

I Just enter haircut followed by the zip code of the Hotel where I'm staying - 02114, and instantly, find  Richard's Haircutting for Men a scant 0.4 miles east and with directions.

Both have compiled enormous databases containing detailed information on most of the businesses and consumer households in the US and Canada. And much of their data is pulled from your basic Yellow Page and Business White Page directories (aka, the cheesy doorstops) .\n\nThe good news may be that your business already has a listing in your <span>local Yellow Pages,</span> if not, then you should get one! Don't worry about taking out a big colorful ad with lots of information about your company. We haven't any reason to believe that expensive ads offer any advantage in local search rankings. Nor does lots of business information in your Yellow Pages ad seem to enhance your local search listing's comprehensiveness. It appears to us that any Yellow Pages listing at all will get you included in most local search engines just fine.\n\n<Span>What is the most important thing you could do for your businesses is Local Search?</span>\n\n<span>Sign up for Google My Business!</Span>\n\nGoogle My Business is essential for Local SEO as it enables your business listing to appear in local search results for queries specific to your products or services. Even broad queries with large search volumes display local results in the three-pack, and this is something small business owners can capitalize on. It is a tool to manage your online presence across the Google suite of websites, including Google Search, Mobile Search, Local Search and Google Maps. It allows you to create, verify and edit a business listing in Google, without needing to do any extra work to your website or implementing a search engine optimization strategy.\n\nIn a nutshell, make sure that your business has an up-to-date and detailed Google My Business listing. If you have not taken the time to create and optimize one, then you’re missing out on one of the best free (and guaranteed!) ways of appearing in the Google search results.\n\nGoogle My Business pages aren’t complicated, but they are important.

And, there is nothing sinister, or wrong with it. That’s just the way we are as human beings. It’s what makes us tick.

Look carefully, & see how skillfully it evokes one or more of these powerful emotions. Try to get a sense of how you feel when you read it.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 'TWO YOUNG MEN' LETTER on a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young men graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable, and as young college graduates are - were filled with ambitious dreams for the future. Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion. They were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three children. And both, it turned out, had gone to work for the same Midwestern manufacturing company after graduation, and were still there.But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small department of that company. The other was its president. Have you ever wondered, as I have, what makes this kind of difference in people's lives? It isn't always a native intelligence or talent or dedication. It isn't that one person wants success and the other doesn't. The difference lies in what each person knows and how he or she makes use of that knowledge. And that is why I am writing to you and to people like you about The Wall Street Journal. For that is the whole purpose of The Journal: To give its readers knowledge - knowledge that they can use in business. The letter closes: About those two college classmates I mention at the beginning of this letter: They were graduated from college together and together got started in the business world. So what made their lives in business different? Knowledge. Useful knowledge. And its application. I cannot promise you that success will be instantly yours if you start reading The Wall Street Journal. But I can guarantee that you will find The Journal always interesting, always reliable, and always useful. This is a newspaper! It doesn’t get much more mundane than that, but the same principle applies, do you see the power in it? What we are talking about here are emotions that are inextricably tied to the universal desire for esteem that’s hard wired into our nature as human beings. If you’ve got a pulse, you’re under its spell. But here’s the kicker. Most of the time, we are not even aware of the stimulus, only the response. When you were reading the story about the graduates and the reunion, chances are, you were playing out your own meta program inside your head, and experiencing one of the esteem emotions. And it triggered your own personal desire to show the world what you could do, didn’t it? Esteem (to feel valued), is NOT a WANT at all. It is a basic human NEED almost as fundamental as food & water. Your prospect’s hunger & thirst for it. Their emotions are the expressions of that craving. If you can trigger them, & then associate satisfaction of the “esteem needs” with your product, you’ve got a winning ad!`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-9   --->  \"5-components-of-website-useability.jpg\" <----    */\n\n    {\n        id: 9,\n        title: \"Website Manifestation - 5 Steps to a Successful website\",\n        author: \"Constance Beebe\",\n        date: \"07/2020\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_9_5-components-of-website-useability.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"5 Components of Website Useability\",\n        category: \"Website Useability\",\n        tags: \"Website Useability, Custom Website Design, Website Content Writing, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Digital Graphic Design, Website Maintenance, Website Usability\",\n        snippet: \"The more time and effort you put into planning and building your website, or revamping an existing one, the more successful you'll be.

From conception to reality, the process of manifesting a website draws upon a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nThe more time and effort you put into planning and building your website, or revamping an existing one, the more successful you'll be. Your new site will have more potential in accomplishing your business goals, your business will look more credible to all the people visiting your site, and you'll increase your bottom line.\n\nThe following is a guide for building a new website. It shows how a corporate webmaster or Web department creates a world-class website, and it is the same step by step process that every organization, no matter how small, should follow.\n\n<span>Step 1 - Discovery:</span> The first phase involves determining the scope of the project, the timeline and scheduling parameters, everyone's expectations, and your current human and technical resources.\n\n<span/>Step 2 - Concept and Planning: </span>The next step is to determine site requirements, business goals, types of functionality, site features, and a timeline and due date. You'll need to determine who your site audience is, the\ndemographics and psychographics of your visitors.\n\nIn this phase, the architecture or organization of the information that will be included on the site needs to be planned as well. The most important part of this step is determining your goals for the site. You need to ask yourself and any other stakeholders exactly what the new site ought to yield when completed. What do you expect the site to do? What do you want to get out of it? What messages do you want to convey to all the people who will eventually view it? What are the priorities of the site in terms of your business and making money? What types of\npeople will be using the site and what will they want to accomplish while there?\n\n<span>Step 3 - Design Specifications: </span>This is when the look & feel and a visual design specification are created. Here you'll determine the fonts, colors, and size and layouts, always trying to keep consistency paramount. You'll want to write specifications for the images you'll be using on the site as well. It's also the time to decide upon and design the technical infrastructure and architecture of the site, server, environment, and platform. You'll determine what programming languages and databases will be used if any, and any other technical features your site will need.\n\nOne of the secondary benefits of following Step 3 is that you'll have a document to refer back to later on when adding to the site. If you hire a new Web person of the company, you can give them this design specification document for them to follow whenever they work on your site.\n\n<span>Step 4 - Production: </span>Before this phase begins, everyone who is involved in this project, including people who give the final ‘ok', need to know that there will be a technical and look and feel design freeze at this point. If any changes are needed during this point, then those changes will be done in the next redesign.\n\n<span>The production phase can be broken down into three areas and will include:\n</span><span>Step 4a- The Design Production:</span> The artistic look and feel design production, usability designing, the navigation production, and image and button creation. The homepage of the site and the inner page template both need the new design applied to them. The homepage design may use the same template the rest of the site uses, or it may be unique. If it differs from the rest of the site, then make sure its look and feel are very similar to the look and feel of the inner page template(s). Also, if it differs, consider applying this entire step-by-step guide to the homepage as well, treating it as a separate, but related entity.\n\n<span>Step 4b - The Technical Production:</span> This entails the HTML coding, any other coding to contribute to the functionality and the configuration of the server's environment. The technical aspects could also include any Server-Side Coding in a major programming language, Database Design and Development, and site security measures.\n\n<span>Step 4c - The Marketing Production:</span> This area includes creating the homepage and pre-determined inner pages to be search engine and index friendly. It also includes the copywriting for every page. Any mechanisms for interacting with the visitors will be produced here. For example, forms on your site that asks users to give information are ways for a user to interact with your site. Although the look & feel of the form falls under ‘design', and the actual mechanisms that make the formwork fall under ‘technology', the purpose of the forms will be very marketing-centric. What you ask, how you store the data, and how you retrieve it and use it later are all marketing issues that\nshould be addressed in this step.\n\n<span>Step 5 - Testing: </span>The produced site now must be loaded onto a staging area that is exactly like the production environment or made accessible to testers only. During this phase, various people will test all aspects of the site, including functionality, spelling and grammar, hyperlinks, and all other elements. This is often called the Quality Assurance phase.\n\n<span>Step 6 - Publishing: </span>This phase is the push of the new site from staging to production. Here the site is made life and is now on the World Wide Web.\n\n<span>Step 7 - E-marketing and Maintenance: </span>Unless the site is marketed, it won't matter how well-designed or technically robust it is, no one will ever visit or use it. Therefore, the final and ongoing phase entails implementing E-marketing techniques, keeping the site's content fresh, and making continual adjustments based on site-specific and customer research.\n\nWhether you decide to tackle building a new website yourself, or you choose to hire someone else to do it, the steps outlined above ought to be followed. If you decide to do it yourself, you'll need to read up on Graphic Design and Usability, Web Technologies, and E-marketing.\n\nIf you hire an outside company to build a site for you, ask them how they plan to accomplish it. Ask them if they have a set method for building a new site or revamping an old one. If they have a good system, they ought to look a lot like the steps above. They ought to be proficient in all aspects of website development and be able to communicate to you everything they are doing and why. Remember, the better your site is initially and the better you manage your new site going forward, the better your business will be.`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-10   --->    \"get-it-in-writing.jpg\"    <----    */\n\n    {\n        id: 10,\n        title: \"New client?

If Hortensia hadn't found a sample agreement, I would have suggested she surf the web. Typing 'contract' plus your form of service, will often pull up examples you can use to get started. Sample agreements usually are created by experienced business owners. They help you identify your client's hot buttons: price, delivery date, guarantees, and more. Each field will be different. For instance, if you're a web designer, who will be responsible for the images you use on a website? If your client supplies images or copy, make sure they agree in writing, to be responsible for any possible copyright claims. Will your ability to perform your job be affected by what your client gives you? Make sure they understand, you can't meet a deadline if they haven't delivered all the copy by a certain date.

If your company's style calls for informality, you can draft a memo that sounds friendly and supportive, not legalistic.\n\nSome organizations and some industries run on a handshake and everybody's happy. But other times, you will hear, 'We all agree on everything,' and learn - too late - that some of these happy people are signing severance agreements behind closed doors.\n\nThese days, I would consider written agreements even for lawn mowing, house cleaning and dog washing services.

In order to do so, your website design should focus on performing only one <span>function.</span> and that’s to convey your sales message to your site visitors in an effective and efficient manner.\n\nNo matter what your web designer tells you, simplicity is best when building your small business website. While having a website with lots of bright colors and flashy interactive graphics might win web design awards, it will probably not help you win customers. In fact, the more complicated your web design, the higher the risk that your sales message will be lost amidst all the fancy bells and whistles on your site.\n\nFor most small businesses, a simple and elegant four or five-page website is all they need to get the job done. As an added bonus, such sites are inexpensive when compared to flashier multimedia sites. If you want your small business website to increase your profits instead of emptying your pocketbook, pay close attention to the following design guidelines when you build your site.\n\n<span>Make Your Website Easy to Read</span>\nIn order for your website to get sales and/or leads, your small business website design needs to be user and consumer-friendly - that means it needs to be easy to read. So, short sentences and paragraphs, dark text on white (or very, very light) backgrounds, and lots of white space should be the norm.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, I’ll say it again - the purpose of having a website for your small business isn’t to win design awards. It’s to convey information about your product or service that guides the consumer toward making a buying decision in your favor.\n\nIf you think that dark websites and colored text on colored backgrounds look better, you may be right. However, as I mentioned earlier, loud colors and excessive graphics only serve to distract attention from the sales message contained in your site content and make your site harder to read. Remember: keep it simple and you’ll keep the sale.\n\nAlso, remember that web users tend to scan text instead of reading it start to finish like printed text. Since the majority of your visitors will not read all your content, use headlines, subheadings, and bolded text that quickly convey your overall message. Done correctly, a visitor should be able to scan all your headlines, subheads, and bold text in just a few seconds and understand the central message of your site or page.\n\n<span>Make Your Website Easy to Navigate</span>\nSince the chief purpose of your site is to convey information, you should design your website so the information it contains is easy to find. If you make it easy for your visitors to navigate your site, they’ll thank you with their dollars. Make it difficult, and they’ll leave your website before you can say “Google.”\n\nAt the bare minimum, you should have a navigation bar on every webpage that includes a link back to your home page and to every top-tier page on your website. In addition, you should consider placing links back to the previous page visited at the top and bottom of the current page. Some websites use “bread crumbs” for this <span>purpose.</span> a “trail” of links that show each page visited since landing at the site.\n\nLastly, make sure that there are no broken links on your website. Broken links may not seem like a big deal to you, but to a site visitor who was clicking on a link for more information they are a major frustration. Fix your broken links!\n\nOh, and incidentally, making your site easy to navigate will also help the search engines to find and index all your pages, which might help you get more traffic over the long haul.\n\n<span>Make Sure Your Website Loads Quickly</span>\nDespite the fact that high-speed internet access has become very affordable and accessible in recent years, many web users are still using dial-up connections to access the internet. Note that these people get very frustrated when they have to wait five minutes for your webpage to load. You will lose these visitors if your web page files are too large and take too long to load.\n\nKeep photos, graphics, and animations to a tasteful minimum on your websites, and keep your total page size under 50K to ensure maximum usability for your visitors. In addition, avoid using background music on your pages unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nAnother way to increase the speed of your website is by using SSR (Server Side Rendering). SSR allows your website to load within 3-5 milliseconds (depending on the amount of graphics and video on your site). This will allow your visitors quicker access to your website and onto buying your products.\n\nBy the way, smaller and faster loading pages make it easier for the search engines to <span>spider and rank your site. </span>An added bonus for keeping your page files small and your load times fast.\n\nHopefully, these guidelines will help you build a website that gets you more sales and leads for your small business. Remember, building a website that your visitors enjoy browsing will boost customer loyalty and encourage repeat sales. Create a fast-loading site that’s easy to read and navigate, and your visitors will thank you with their debit cards!`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-13   --->    \"What-is-organic-search-and-how-can-it-help-your-company.jpg\"      <----    */\n\n    {\n        id: 13,\n        title: \"What is 'organic' search and how can it help your company?\",\n        author: \"Constance Beebe\",\n        date: \"6/2020\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_13_What-is-organic-search-and-how-can-it-help-your-company.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"Organic Search: The Concept of Pure, or Crawler-Based Search.\",\n        category: \"Organic SEO\",\n        tags: \"Organic SEO, Website Content Writing, Custom Website Design, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Digital Graphic Design, E-Commerce Website Development\",\n        snippet: \"While optimizing your website to rank well for organic searches takes more effort than simply buying an ad, it can provide your business with one of the highest ROI results that you're likely to find. Numerous studies have placed search engine optimization at the top of the list of the most effective forms of online marketing. Its low cost, high relevancy, and high conversion rates make it an ideal marketing vehicle for almost any business.\",\n\n        content: `\nThe first time I heard the term <span>\"organic search\"</span> I immediately thought of organic food at the grocery store. So, is this organic search healthier for me? Will it reduce my chances of getting cancer? Not only can the search engines bring most of the world's knowledge to my desktop, but now they can prevent deadly diseases too! Imagine my disappointment when I learned organic search was simply the next new buzzword for the concept of pure, or crawler-based search. As some of our readers may find it challenging to keep up with all of the latest lingo, I thought I'd take a moment to at least explain the concept of organic search.\n\nOrganic describes a search that returns results by indexing pages based on content and keyword relevancy. This is in contrast to listings ranked based on who paid the most money to appear at the top such as those on Bing. Sometimes this is called \"pure\" or \"natural search\" as it is supposed to be \"untainted\" by commercial payments or bids.\n\nHistorically, Google has led the way in championing the virtues of natural or \"organic search\". Its primary focus has always been to return fast, highly relevant results based on the content of the page, the relevancy of links pointing to that page, and other \"objective\" criteria. Sponsored listings have always been clearly separated from the organic search results on Google. However, many other engines have experimented with mixing the two types of search without clearly labeling which is which. This has been followed by public outcries, and at least one cautionary set of statements issued by the FTC in 2002, 2011, 2018, and 2020.\n\n<span>Pros and Cons of Organic Search vs Paid Search.</span>\n\nUnlike organic foods at your local grocery store, you aren't required to pay extra to reap the healthy benefits of \"organic\" search. So what are the benefits of organic over paid search?\n\nPROS:\n\n<span>1. Greater Click-throughs:</span> People trust <span>\"organically grown\"</span> search results more than they do sponsored results. While the engines business is supported by paid ads, many consumers prefer the organic search results. Due to the contextual nature of organic search, the listings can be more relevant and offer a greater depth of choices. Therefore, while paid ads can play an important part in your marketing strategy, ultimately it is the organic search results that will more likely yield the greater click-through rates when all other things are equal. Therefore, it's this type of listing that will maximize the traffic to your site whenever you climb to the top.\n\n<span>2. Power of Branding:</span> More and more large corporations are investing resources into organic search to gain the marketing benefits of promoting their brand. For example, most consumers would expect to find Dell.com in a search for computers. If your company does not show up for the keyword results in which you'd expect to appear it can be embarrassing. Consumers may wonder if Company X is as important as they once were if they don't even show up in Bing, Yahoo, or Google. Conversely, inserting your brand in the top search results can give the impression that your company is important. Therefore, smaller companies can give the impression of big business importance by securing a better position in organic search than their larger rivals.\n\n<span>3. Greater Trust Equals Greater Conversions:</span> Most adults learn to apply a healthy dose of skepticism when they see a commercial on TV, a banner ad on the Web, or a sponsored ad on a search engine. After all, we know those ads are commercially motivated and may not always be the most relevant product or solution for our needs. It may simply represent the company that was able to spend the most money to get their message in front of me. Sometimes bigger companies do offer the best products, but there's no guarantee. There's certainly not the same level of trust that we see from visitors arriving from organic search. Organic search can, of course, be commercially influenced. However, a recent survey shows that people tend to trust organic results compared to sponsored listings. On the whole, you should see more visitors from organic search converting to sales, assuming your rankings were for targeted, relevant keywords. In the business world, ROI, or Return On Investment, is king. Fortunately, organic search can give you the high ROI you're looking for or your boss is demanding.\n\n<span>4. Organic is Free:</span> After all these years, it's still free to submit to Google, arguably the most popular of the organic search engines right now. Google has always been adamant about not charging for inclusion in its index of 4.2 billion pages. Most other organic engines will also index you for free, although some like Yahoo do have paid inclusion options. Paid inclusion simply guarantees your page will get indexed quickly and stay indexed for as long as you maintain your subscription, but does not promise a particular ranking. However, if you have a website with good quality content and links from third party sites, paid inclusion is \"nice-to-have\". It can be very useful in getting pages indexed or re-indexed quickly. This allows you to quickly test various page designs and to feed news and other time-sensitive content to the search engine as quickly as possible.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n<span>1. Organic Rankings are Not Automatic:</span> With organic listings, you cannot simply hand over a certain amount of money and be guaranteed to quickly and automatically achieve any ranking you desire. Instead, achieving positions in organic search requires the proper technology, skill, and know-how. There has always been a cloud of mystery around the process of achieving top rankings. How's it done? Where do I start? That's why resources like this newsletter and products like WebPosition Gold are essential to a business's success in search engine marketing.\n\n<span>2. Organic Rankings Require an Investment in Time:</span> The age-old adage of \"nothing worthwhile in life ever comes easy\" rings true with organic rankings. While they are monetarily free, simply submitting your pages to the search engines is not enough to bring in a flood of new visitors to your website. Far too many businesses have been fooled into spending $100 or $400 to submit their site to \"thousands\" of sites, 99% of which are obscure names you've probably never heard of. The key is that someone doing a search on a major search engine must be able to easily find your website. If your site is buried at the bottom of the list, or simply fails to appear in the first few pages of search results, you can kiss your chances of being found good-bye. The key is to use responsible best practices to create pages that are highly relevant to the keywords that apply to your website and the products or solutions you have to offer. . In other words, optimize your pages for search engine visibility and see how fast your position improves. To do this, you simply need to know what each search engine needs for maximum visibility. Then tweak your Web page's content while paying attention to off-page factors like the number and type of links coming to your page. Tune the pages of your site to the preferences of the major search engines and then watch your rankings and traffic climb.\n\nWhile optimizing your website to rank well for organic searches takes more effort than simply buying an ad, it can provide your business with one of the highest ROI results that you're likely to find. Numerous studies have placed search engine optimization at the top of the list of the most effective forms of online marketing. Its low cost, high relevancy, and high conversion rates make it an ideal marketing vehicle for almost any business.\n\nThe catch? As with any area of marketing, SEO is a competitive field. Arming yourself with the best technology and knowledge is key to gaining a competitive advantage.

Are you trying to get your visitors to purchase something or have them sign up for your newsletter? Remember, you are trying to get someone you can't see and have never met, take a step towards building a relationship with you or your company.\n\n<span>1. Create a customer profile –                 </span> try to find out what are the needs and desires of your visitors. Below are some examples of questions you could ask:\n\nAre they young, middle aged or senior?Are they primarily male or female?Are they financially secure or budget-minded?What gets him or her excited?What are his or her most pressing concerns?\n\nTry to brainstorm a list of topics that might interest your target audience.\n\n<span>2. Create a Unique Selling Position (USP) – </span> This is a statement of 2-3 sentences that explains why you are different from everybody else. This is the unique factor that sets you apart from your competition. Make this the first thing your visitor sees when they arrive on your home page.\n\n<span>3. Focus on benefits –</span> most web users want to find the information about the product or service they need as fast as possible. If they land on your site, they want to know how they will benefit from buying your product or subscribing to your e-zine. You will need to answer that question as clearly and concisely as possible or you will lose that visitor.\n\n<span>4. Use the inverted pyramid style –</span> provide a summary of your information by clearly communicating the direction of your discussion. Use informative headings and subheadings with a paragraph of 4 to 5 lines that supports them. You only have a few seconds to grab your visitors attention. Most will simply scan for the information they are seeking.\nUse bulleted or numbered lists, boldface or colored font to emphasize the points you wish to make. Include links at the end of your paragraph (or within the text) to direct visitors to other pages of your site for more in-depth information.\n\n<span>5. Write in an informal or personal style –</span> write in a unique way that differentiates you from other small businesses in a similar business or niche. It doesn't have to be elaborate or super-creative. You simply provide a style that gets the attention of your visitors.\n\n<span>6. Keep your sentences simple –</span> you are not writing to impress. You are writing to communicate. You want to pre-sell your product or service, therefore write as if you are talking to a 13 year old.\nDon't use large words but opt for strong verbs over weak ones. Use the active voice instead of a passive one. i.e. Instead of \"a good score was achieved by the team\"...say \"the team scored a season high\". Speak \"to\" but not \"at\" your visitor. Keep your sentences short and snappy.\n\n<span>7. Include searchable keywords –</span> use targeted keywords in your web copy that will allow the search engines to find your site. Include these keywords in your meta tags, links and file names also.\n\n<span>8. Eliminate the fluff -</span> don't waffle on in your writing. You will only bore your visitors and they will click elsewhere. Try to remove filler sentences that contain phrases like \"for those of you\" and \"all of you\".\n\n<span>9. Proof read your web copy –</span> errors in your web copy give the impression of being unprofessional or sloppy. Read the copy aloud to yourself or get someone else to proof read it. Often they will find more errors because they are more objective.\n\nUse the spell checker but don't rely on it. Often it doesn't pick up all incorrectly spelled words. Print a copy of your content. It's easier to find grammatical or spelling errors on a hard copy.\n\n<span>10. Take a break –</span> revise your web copy after taking a break from it for several hours or a few days. This allows you to see it from a different viewpoint. You may find a better way to say something to further improve your copy.\n\n<span>11. Use images sparingly –</span> images should only be used if they relate and support your web content. If not, they will only distract the visitor from reading your web copy. Too many images will slow down the time it takes for your visitor to load your site in their browser.\n\n<span>12. Use effective navigation –</span> your navigation bar should help visitors easily find the main sections of your site.\nWriting effective web copy is the key to converting visitors into buyers. Getting 1000s of visitors to your website doesn't guarantee sales. Reading your web copy should pre-sell your product with the words you use. Once you achieve this, your website will become very profitable.`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-16   --->    \"How-to-Write-Effective-Website-Copy.jpg\"    <----    */\n\n\n    {\n        id: 16,\n        title: \"Build It And They Will Come.

Now you have your beautiful website boasting your amazing products or services. It's out there, just waiting for people who want what you have to offer. You're going to dazzle them with your dynamic website and the sales are going to come flooding in. Wrong. The dream is over. It's time to come back to reality.\n\nI can't begin to tell you how many times I've heard the stories of disappointment from very sharp business people who actually thought that having a website is all there is to either starting and operating a successful and profitable online business, or incorporating E-Commerce into their existing business of traditional commerce.\n\nYour website is quite simply, a brochure that is now lost in a very large online ocean of literally billions of other brochures. We'll compare it to a stack of beautifully printed brochures sitting on your desk; your prospects will never see it unless you place your brochures in a visible place where people look for what you have to offer - true? Your online brochure, (your website), also needs to be positioned in a visible place where your prospects can find you - on major search engine directories.\n\nKeywords and key phrases are the search words and terms Internet surfers use to find the products, services or information they are looking for.\n\nChoosing the right keywords and phrases for your website's search engine optimization (SEO) program is critical to its success. The right keywords drive targeted traffic to your website - prospects who are ready to buy. The wrong keywords attract web visitors that are not likely to purchase your products and services - wasting everyone's time and your money.\n\nBy following these simple rules, you will be able to determine the right mix of keywords and phrases that will generate targeted prospects to your website. Remember that good search terms are those that are related to your business and have sufficient monthly search traffic.\n\n<span>Rule #1.  Select keywords that represent your company's 'bread and butter.'</span> What products and service lines are the most profitable, have the strongest sales, and continue to show good market demand. And yes, typically the 80/20 rule applies here. 80% of your sales and sales leads are produced by 20% of your keywords and phrases.\n\n<span>Rule #2. Look at complementary products and services that people tend to buy that you don't offer.</span> Often, these keywords generate good prospects and typically have less competition than your primary keywords and phrases.\n\n<span>Rule #3. Use online tools to help determine keyword variations and search frequency.</span> The best free programs to use include <a href='https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/'>Google’s search term suggestion tool</a> and <a href='https://www.wordstream.com/keywords'>Word Stream’s keyword tool</a>.\n\n<span>Rule #4. Use <a href='www.wordtracker.com'>WordTracker</a> -</span> For a small fee, you can use this tool to find niche keywords, use the thesaurus to find related search terms and determine general monthly search frequency. This is a great tool and worth the investment.\n\n<span>Rule #5. Use pay-per-click programs like Google's AdWords to choose keywords and phrases for your SEO program.</span> Both programs help you generate search terms based on specific keyword relationships and show how often they are searched for. Set a small monthly budget and track the number of keyword impressions you receive for each search term. After one to two months of data, choose the search terms with adequate search frequency and incorporate them into your 'search engine optimization' program.\n\n<span>Rule #6. Don't forget Geographics.</span> If your products and services are local or regional, be sure to include your state or city within your search phrases. For example, an investigations company that conducts most of its business in the Midwest would want to choose 'Indiana and private investigator.'\n\n<span>Rule #7. Take a look at your competition.</span> Based on your top three competitors, look at their website for specific search terms being used. Also, look at their META keywords to get a good idea of what search terms they think are important. Remember you want to look at competitors for your different markets served and products and service lines.\n\n<span>Rule #8. Analyze your website traffic.</span> Make sure your web hosting company provides you with the ability to analyze your website log files. Some hosting companies have you log into your account to view monthly web traffic reports, while others email monthly reports. Information obtained can tell you the top search terms and search engines used to find your website and other valuable information. To get the most out of your log file data, it is recommended to use a log file analyzer such as Web Trends or Google Ad-Words.\n\nBy applying these simple rules, you will be well on your way to generating highly-targeted keywords and phrases that attract the right prospects - prospects who have direct interest in what you have to offer.`\n    },\n\n    /* ID-17   --->    \"How-to-Write-Effective-Website-Copy.jpg\"    <----    */\n\n    {\n        id: 17,\n        title: \"Social Media: Why It Is 100% Essential (and How to Use It Well)\",\n        author: \"Constance Beebe\",\n        date: \"9/2020\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_17_marketing-through-social-media.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"Social Media is used to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current and possible new clients, and help foster new business.\",\n        category: \"Strategic Social Media Marketing\",\n        tags: \"Brand Loyalty, Consumer Loyalty, Affordable Custom Website Design, Strategic Social Media Marketing, Content Writing, Ad-Copywriting\",\n        snippet: \"In today’s society, word of mouth IS digital.

While many people access social media through smartphone apps, this communication tool started with computers, and social media can refer to any internet communication tool that allows users to broadly share content and engage with the public.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\">Wikipedia</a>, “Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.” They go on further to say,” Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online\">online</a> communities and can be an effective communication (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing\">marketing</a>) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments.”\n\nIn today’s society, word of mouth IS digital.  Think about the questions you constantly ask about products, services, or businesses; your customers are asking the SAME questions. Addressing these common points of confusion could be your key to converting casual website visitors into new clients. The biggest question of all though is whether potential customers will WANT to visit your website based on your social media presence. So, start or join a conversation, and participate with the idea in mind that you can achieve a significant influence. Take hold and grow your brand by taking hold of your social media presence!\n\n<span>“How can a social media presence  help my business?”</span>  Social media is used to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current and possibly new clients, and help foster new business. Again, you ask “How?”  Let’s start with some statistics that will help you to understand the importance of social media marketing. In fact, it is so important that 97% of marketers are using social media and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2013/05/19/study-78-of-salespeople-using-social-media-outsell-their-peers/#715beee67c32\">78% of salespeople outsell their peers</a> simply by using social media for their business.\n\nHowever, not all businesses are aware of the benefits of social media marketing. In fact, <a href=\"http://stlblackbiz.com/small-businesses-arent-readily-using-social-media/\">50% of small businesses aren’t using social media</a> to promote their business and an additional 25% don’t plan to use social media in the future. There is clearly a large disconnect between those who are seeing the benefits of social media and those struggling to get started.\n\nYou may ask, <span>“How will my business benefit from an active social media presence?”</span>  Here are just three of the ways your business could benefit:\n\n    ◆   Social Media can be a valuable tool as profiles can provide general information and updates about your business.\n    ◆   Businesses can interact and engage with current and future clients in a community-like setting.\n    ◆   Your business’ social profiles can also help improve your organic SEO for your website.\n\n<a href=\"https://clutch.co/agencies/resources/social-media-2015-small-business-survey\">Mike Rosa</a> of 180Fusion, stated that <span>“If small businesses want to compete, if they want to level the playing field with their competitors, if they don’t want to lose ground, they have to be participating in social media.”</span>\n\nThe world of digital tech is a constantly moving landscape with social media marketing seeming to move even faster. And because it’s so fast-moving it can be tough to figure out how each piece of the puzzle fits with your small business. Social Media Engagement remains an essential ingredient of business and marketing success. To win over audiences in a world increasingly dominated by instantaneous social media and the 24-hour news cycle, the power of connecting with people can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nIf you would like to increase your Social Media Presence or create it, I invite you to give us a call or email us at Blue Smoke Digital and Printed Media.

You must exploit the advantages many small businesses have over large companies. \",\n        content: `\n<span>When starting a business or website on the Internet,</span> it is often easy to become intimidated by large companies or web sites offering similar services to you. While you may not be able to match the million-dollar advertising budgets or employee numbers of your competitors, there are many things you can do to make your business or website stand out from the rest. This article aims to provide you with an approach, and the motivation to take on those competitors you never thought you could match!\n\nThroughout the rest of this article, I will be using the example of a hypothetical small web design company called “Coffee Digital Cafe ”. As you may or may not know, the web design industry is an incredibly competitive market, which makes it an excellent example of this article. With the huge amount of large, well-established companies active in the industry, it would be incredibly easy for a small company such as Coffee Digital Cafe to be swallowed and taken under in the first few months of operation. We will explore some of the tactics the owners of Coffee Cafe Digital may use to gain some kind of advantage over their large competitors.\n\n<span>What do customers want?</span>\nIt is important to get back to basics and ask yourself \"What is it that customers purchasing this service require?\". Knowing some of the decisive factors in customers' choices is very important. If you know what your customers want, you may be able to tailor your marketing strategies to emphasize these areas.\n\n<span>Making a list:</span>\nIn our example of the Coffee Digital Cafe company, the owners may come up with the following list (after researching customer needs) of nine features customers desire in a web design company.\n\n<span>1.</span> Excellent support\n<span>2.</span> Package features (eg. disk quotas, email boxes, monthly bandwidth)\n<span>3.</span> Special language support (eg. JavaScript, PHP, Python, React.js, Ruby on Rails, etc.)\n<span>4.</span> Reasonable pricing\n<span>5.</span> Easy account management\n<span>6.</span> Reliability\n<span>7.</span> Do they write content\n<span>8.</span> Do they have an in-house graphic design team\n<span>9.</span> They offer Social Media Management\n\nAfter reviewing this list, the Coffee Digital Cafe owners could choose areas they believe their big company competitors are lacking. These areas would then become areas of focus for both product development and marketing.\n\nThe first item in the list<span> (Excellent support),</span> is often an area big companies leave a lot to be desired. This opens the door to create a major selling point for the Coffee Digital Cafe service. The reasonably simple task of ensuring the timely response to queries could have customers singing your praises, generating a lot of new business.\n\nSuggestion: If it is feasible for your business, setting up an account on one (or some) of the major instant messaging programs (eg. Chat on your website, Google Meet, and Zoom) can leave an excellent impression on customers. Think about how happy you would be receiving a reply to a query almost instantly!\n\n<span>Getting Info for the List:</span>\n\nYou may be asking just where you are expected to get a lot of information about your customer's needs. Below is a shortlist of suggestions to get you started.\n\n<span>*</span>Survey customers.\n<span>*</span>Participate in discussion groups relating to the subject. You will often find forums around the Internet with real customers discussing what they like and dislike about certain products and services. Participating in these discussions may also get your business!\n<span>*</span>Visit websites and read newsletters that deal with the subject.\n<span>*</span>Put yourself in your customer's shoes and look at it from their perspective.\n\n<span>Personalize your Service</span>\n\nI don't know about you, but I find it much more appealing when I can actually talk to the owner or employees of a business throughout the use of their service. A personal response to an order beats autoresponders any day!\n\n<span>There are many aspects needed to be considered</span> when personalizing a service. Listening to user feedback, being available to talk, and offering opinions on different issues all contribute to personalizing a service. The common goal of many of these aspects is to build trust with your customers.\n\n<span>Building trust with your customers is an incredibly important</span> and often underestimated aspect, which must be considered. To put it simply, no one is going to buy anything from you on the Internet if they do not trust you. <span>Personalizing a service</span> is an excellent way of gaining this customer trust.\n\nOur Coffee Digital Cafe team may decide to incorporate some of the following things to help <span>personalize their service and gain trust</span> from their customers.\n\n<span>**On sign up,</span> Coffee Digital Cafe should ensure customers have the contact information for appropriate personnel to voice their queries or comments.

Especially, if it is\ngoing to get them a service that the big competitors do not provide so well.\n\nIn conclusion, <span>the best thing you can do as a small business</span> or website starting out on the Internet <span>is to understand your customers and their needs.</span> You must exploit the advantages many small businesses have over large companies. Using the techniques outlined in this article, along with your own initiative and creativity, will help you gain respect, build a reputation, and hopefully reach your goals!`\n    },\n    /* ID-19  --->   How to Market Yourself Like a Corporation\"   <----    */\n\n    {\n        id: 19,\n        title: \"Best Practices: How to Market Yourself Like a Corporation\",\n        author: \"Ramona Lucius\",\n        date: \"07/2020\",\n        imageUrl: \"ID_19_How_to_Market_Yourself_Like a_Corporation.jpg\",\n        imageAlt: \"How to Market Yourself Like a Corporation\",\n        category: \"Corporate Branding\",\n        tags: \"Strategic Social Media Marketing,Affordable Custom Website Design, Typography, Brand Loyalty, Consumer Loyalty, Digital and Print Logo Design, Website Content Writing, Reputation Management\",\n        snippet: \"Corporations are people is probably not a new concept to you.

Let's turn the lens to them - How did they do it?\n\n<span>1)</span> If you engage in social media - consider making your personal pages private and allow\nyour strategized branded pages to be searched publicly. Being yourself is cool and all- but\ndoes your dream job need to know about your obsession with 90's sci-fi?  Probably not.\nThere is potential to use your web print to leave an impression that makes you a more\nattractive candidate.  Consider it.  Friends you want to invite over for a Cleopatra 2525\nmarathon will still be able to get the invite if you tighten the security on your page.\n\n<span>2)</span> Watch the companies you like - what does their web print say about them? Look at\ntheir posts, charities they support, what is the impression they offer? Most companies have\na strategy for their voice - are they supportive, casual, pedantic, etc. Figure out their voice\nand utilize it in your posts. Does this company try to educate the consumer - be a thought\nleader. Offer posts that will attract their attention as someone who is aligned with their\nobjectives and interests.\n\n<span>There are so many opportunities to create your own brand.</span> You can really go down a rabbit\nhole here. Typography, color palette, even the source of information you use when you post are\npaints to create a more colorful picture. Choose wisely.\n\n<span>Everything you give to the world is a handshake. Make it a memorable one!</span>`\n    }\n]\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useParams } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport articleData from \"../data/articles\";\nimport ReactHtmlParser from \"react-html-parser\";\n\nexport default function Article() {\n  const [article, setArticle] = useState({});\n  const { id } = useParams();\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setArticle(articleData.find((e) => e.id == id));\n  }, [id]);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-wrapper\">\n      <h1>{article.title}</h1>\n      <span className=\"author\">{article.author}</span>\n      <pre>{ReactHtmlParser(article.content)}</pre>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/slide-1.941a3115.webp\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/slide-2.6ec7a0f5.webp\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/slide-3.b64b2775.webp\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport \"../style/Carousel/carousel.css\";\n\nimport { CarouselProvider, Slider, Slide, Dot } from \"pure-react-carousel\";\nimport \"pure-react-carousel/dist/react-carousel.es.css\";\nimport slide1 from \"../images/slide-1.webp\";\nimport slide2 from \"../images/slide-2.webp\";\nimport slide3 from \"../images/slide-3.webp\";\n\nexport default function Carousel() {\n  return (\n    <CarouselProvider\n      naturalSlideWidth={100}\n      naturalSlideHeight={45}\n      totalSlides={3}\n      isPlaying={true}\n      interval={6000}\n      currentSlide={0}\n    >\n      <Slider className=\"slider\">\n        <Slide index={0}>\n          <div className=\"inner-slide\">\n            <div className=\"slide-info\">\n              <h1>\n                Does YOUR website\n                <br />\n                enhance YOUR internet\n                <br />\n                presence?\n              </h1>\n              <h4>\n                The first step to an effective web presence is to have a\n                presence!\n              </h4>\n              <p>\n                An abandoned website is almost worse than nothing.
