        Search Engine Friendly Web Design
        <br />
        and Search Engine Optimization
      </h1>
      <h2>
        First, what is search engine friendly web design and search engine
        optimization?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Search engines are a major source of traffic to most websites, but many
        website owners have discovered, simply having a website does not mean
        that people will find it. Enter search engine friendly web design. In
        today’s competitive market, it isn’t just about having great meta tags
        any longer - websites must be built to rank well within the search
        engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <span>Blue Smoke Digital Media</span>, we know that a website’s basic 
        <Link to="/article/5">search engine “friendliness” </Link>
        should, in most cases, be part of the overall design plan for a new
        website. Good search engine rankings are often crucial to the goals of
        our clients. This is why we incorporate these fundamental techniques in
        our designs as a standard part of even our most affordable packages.
      </p>
      <h4>What about high rankings in the search engines?</h4>
      <p>
        Search engines are constantly changing. Additionally, as the number of
        pages on the Web grows, some search engines drop pages in order to make
        room for more — and almost all change how they “rank” pages over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        While developing your custom designed website from the ground up,
        <span> Blue Smoke Digital Media </span>
        includes built in organic search engine optimization. This includes
        online architectural design principles carefully combining information
        delivery and intuitive navigation to satisfy the visitor’s needs.
        However, paid or not, most search engines base how high your website
        ranks on various factors. If yours meets their criteria, you’ll get a
        better ranking than the next website. As part of your website package,
        we will utilize our organic search engine friendly design methodology,
        which has been successful in gaining excellent rankings in the search
        engines.
