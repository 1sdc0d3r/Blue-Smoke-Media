        {" "} Social Media: Why It Is 100% Essential (and How to Use It Well)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Social media is a form of electronic communication designed to let
        people share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. While many
        people access social media through smartphone apps, this communication
        tool started with computers, and social media can refer to any internet
        communication tool that allows users to broadly share content and engage
        with the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">Wikipedia</a>,
        “Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that
        facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas, career
        interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and
        networks.” They go on further to say, ”Social media can help to improve
        an individual's sense of connectedness with real or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online">online</a>
         communities and can be an effective communication (or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing">marketing</a>) tool
        for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy
        groups, political parties, and governments.”

        In today’s society, word of mouth IS digital. Think about the questions
        you constantly ask about products, services or businesses; your
        customers are asking the SAME questions. Addressing these common points
        of confusion could be your key to converting casual website visitors
        into new clients. The biggest question of all though, is whether
        potential customers will WANT to visit your website based on your social
        media presence. So, start or join a conversation, and participate with
        the idea in mind that you can achieve a significant influence. Take a
        hold and grow your brand by taking hold of your social media presence!
      </p>
      <p>
        “How can a social media presence help my business?” Social media is used
        to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current and
        possible new clients, and help foster new business. Again, you ask
        “How?” Let’s start with some statistics that will help you to understand
        the importance of social media marketing. In fact, it is so important
        that 97% of marketers are using social media and 
        <a
          href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2013/05/19/study-78-of-salespeople-using-social-media-outsell-their-peers/#715beee67c32"
        >
          78% of salespeople outsell their peers
        </a>
         simply by using social media for their business.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not all businesses are aware of the benefits of social media
        marketing. In fact, 
        <a
          href="http://stlblackbiz.com/small-businesses-arent-readily-using-social-media/"
        >
          50% of small businesses aren’t using social media
        </a>
         to promote their business and an additional 25% don’t plan to use
        social media in the future. There is clearly a large disconnect between
        those who are seeing the benefits of social media and those struggling
        to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might ask, “How will my business benefit from an active social media
        presence?” Here are just three of the ways your business could benefit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ◆ Social Media can be a valuable tool as profiles can provide general
          information and updates about your business.
        </li>

        <li>
          ◆ Businesses can interact and engage with current and future clients
          in a community like setting.
        </li>

        <li>
          ◆ Your businesses social profiles can also help improve your organic
          SEO for your website.
        </li>
      </ul>

        >
          Mike Rosa </a
        >{" "} of 180Fusion, stated that “If small businesses want to compete,
        if they want to level the playing field with their competitors, if they
        don’t want to lose ground, they have to be participating in social
        media.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The world of digital tech is a constantly moving landscape with social
        media marketing seeming to move even faster. And because it’s so fast
        moving it can be tough to figure out how each piece of the puzzle fits
        with your small or corporate business. Social Media Engagement remains
        an essential ingredient of business and marketing success. To win over
        audiences in a world increasingly dominated by instantaneous social
        media and the 24-hour news cycle, the power of connecting with people
        can be the difference between success and failure.
      </p>
