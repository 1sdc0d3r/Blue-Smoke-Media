          <h3>Have a Question?</h3>
          <p>
            No business is too small for a website, but creating and
            maintaining a website can be daunting. How do you know what to put
            on your website? What color should the buttons be? What does “SEO”
            mean? With so many questions, it can be difficult to focus on what
            matters.
            <br />

            “Identity will be the most valuable commodity for citizens in the
            future, and it will exist primarily online.” <br />
            <span>— Eric Schmidt</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            “Decisions to buy or not buy from a company have increasingly less
            to do with place, packaging, or promotion and almost everything to
            do with how much your friends, family, and even strangers provide
            online assurance that the product or service is worth the cost.”
            <br />
            <span>— Elaine Cheng</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            We interact with friends, family, and colleagues largely through
            text messages, email, and 
            <Link to="/social-media">social media</Link>, where perception and
            reality are often confused. So both digital and in-person first
            impressions are critical!
