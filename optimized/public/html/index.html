            <span>Social media trends are like friends, they come and go.</span>
            However, the best friends and trends usually end up sticking around
            and evolving into a permanent part of our lives with qualities such
            as integrity, dependability, trust, quality and even ROI.

            More than 28% of users from four major social media platforms engage
            with live streams each month on any one of these services. “Video is
            the hottest platform on the planet right now and the cheapest to
            distribute through social media,” said

            <p>
              Custom website design is a process because so much goes into it,
              but businesses get a lot more out of it over the long term.
              <a href="/article/1"> Custom-made websites </a> look better, do
              more, and accomplish specific business goals.

            <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
            <p>
              Making a website <a href="/article/5">SEO friendly</a> means that
              Google and other search engines can crawl each page on the website
              efficiently, interpret the content effectively, and index it in
              their database. Once indexed, they can then serve the most
              relevant and valuable web pages to their users based on the topics
              they search for.

            <h3>Social Media and Internet Marketing</h3>
            <p>
              It’s crucial you determine which platforms you’re going to share
              your content on. There’s not necessarily a right or wrong answer
              when it comes to which <a href="/article/8">social media </a>
              channels your business should use — it’s more about the needs of
              your target audience and where they tend to spend their time.
